# Iris Flower Prediction with TensorFlow Lite Model in React Native using Native Modules

## Summary

The Iris Flower Prediction project leverages React Native to create a mobile application capable of predicting the species of Iris flowers using a TensorFlow Lite model. The core functionality of the application is implemented using Kotlin through native modules, allowing seamless integration of machine learning capabilities into the React Native environment.

### Key Components

1. **React Native Framework:** The application is built using React Native, a popular framework for developing cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React.
   
2. **TensorFlow Lite Model:** A pre-trained machine learning model for predicting the species of Iris flowers is integrated into the application. TensorFlow Lite enables efficient execution of machine learning models on mobile devices.
   
3. **Native Modules:** Native modules written in Kotlin are utilized to bridge the gap between React Native and the TensorFlow Lite model. These modules provide a way to access platform-specific functionalities and libraries.
   
4. **Prediction Function:** The core functionality of the application lies in the prediction function, which takes input features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, and returns the predicted species of the Iris flower using the TensorFlow Lite model.
   
5. **User Interface:** The React Native application features an intuitive user interface where users can input the parameters of an Iris flower and receive the predicted species as output.
   
6. **Performance Optimization:** TensorFlow Lite ensures efficient execution of the machine learning model on mobile devices, enabling real-time predictions with minimal latency.
   
7. **Testing and Deployment:** The application is thoroughly tested to ensure accurate predictions across various input scenarios. Once tested, it can be deployed to app stores for users to download and utilize.

### Benefits

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** React Native allows the application to be deployed on both iOS and Android platforms without the need for separate codebases.
   
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Users can obtain predictions on the species of Iris flowers instantly, enhancing the usability and practicality of the application.
   
- **Integration Flexibility:** By utilizing native modules, the project offers flexibility in integrating additional machine learning models or expanding functionalities in the future.
   
- **Mobile Accessibility:** The mobile application enables users to perform flower species prediction on-the-go, catering to a wide range of users including botanists, hobbyists, and students.
